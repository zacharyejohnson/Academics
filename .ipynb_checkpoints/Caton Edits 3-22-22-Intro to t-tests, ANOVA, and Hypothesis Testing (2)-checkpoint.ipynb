    "Creating accurate predictions is one of the most valuable skills in the job market today. Statisticians, economists, and data scientists use data gathered from specific populations in order to predict the future. Through computational and statistical techniques, we can make _statistical inferences_ to draw conclusions from data that are often incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as estimations of parameters that already exist, having full population data would mean that our questions about that population are answered. But because the cost of gathering a full set of information typically outweigh the benefits of having perfectly accurate data, we are okay with use data samples to draw inferences about past data and predict future observations.

    "The term “index fund” refers to the investment approach of a fund. Specifically, it is a fund that that aims to match the performance of a particular market index, such as the S&P 500 or Russell 2,000. The index fund simply tries to match the market. This differs from a more actively managed fund, in which investments are picked by a fund manager in an attempt to beat the market. The age old question is: are the fees payed to an actively-managed mutual fund worth it? \n",
    "\n",
    "We could simply compare the mean return from a given date range for a mutual fund and compare it to the S&P500s mean return from the same time interval, and see which is higher. But the fact that mutual funds have a limited number of time intervals which we can sample means we cannnot rule out the possibility that higher or lower returns from the fund were a result of random variation, and not an indicator of the true quality of the fund. Returns to investment in the S&P500 is a quality proxy for returns in equity markets. Although returns to the S&P 500 experience stochasticity, on average the average rate of return from a mutual fund data should beat S&P returns on average if active investment is actually improving the rate of return. So, we need to analyze the two funds using statistical techniques which account for random variation that is possible from incomplete data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to ananlyze which(if any) mutual funds have out-performed the market, fees included. To start, we read the CSV downloaded from [Stock Market MBA](https://stockmarketmba.com/listoftop100activelymanagedusstockmutualfunds.php), which shows the 100 largest actively-managed mutual funds in the US.
