The Economy as a Distributed Genetic Algorithm 

A comparison of neoclassical economic theory and heuristic-based decision making.

This project simulates agent behavior in the Sugarscape (Epstein and Axtell 1996) as either neoclassical (optimizer) or heuristic-based (basic), with optional arbitrageur agent. 

Project: https://github.com/zacharyejohnson/Academics/tree/main/Sugarscape

How to run: 

1. install dependencies listed in requirements.txt
2. in GUI.py file, define (at bottom of file) number of runs per simulation(var: runs), breed sets to be included in simulation(var: primary_breeds_sets), and number of periods in run (var: periods). Tweak any remaining agent or model parameters you want to test. Set live_visual to True for live visual and plots to True for plots at the end of a single run. Model will run quicker if these are false. 
3. Run GUI.py file
4. Email me with questions: zachary.e.johnson@ndsu.edu


This project is part of my masters thesis for applied economics, with advisor Dr. Jim Caton at NDSU. See https://github.com/jlcatonjr.
